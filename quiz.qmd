### Question 1: Sequences

What function in R creates a sequence of integers from 1 to 10?

```{webr-r}
# Write your answer below and run it.
# The output should be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Show Answer

```r
1:10
# or
seq(1, 10)
```

### Question 2: Summary Statistics

Using base R, calculate the mean of the vector `c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)`.

```{webr-r}
# Write your answer below


```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Show Answer

```r
mean(c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42))
# Answer: 18
```

### Question 3: Data Frames

Create a data frame with two columns: `name` (with values "Alice", "Bob", "Carol") and `score` (with values 90, 85, 92). Then filter to only rows where score > 88.

```{webr-r}
# Write your answer below


```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Show Answer

```r
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
  score = c(90, 85, 92)
)
df[df$score > 88, ]
```

## Interactive R in the Browser

Edit and run the code below -- it executes entirely in your browser via [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/).

```{webr-r}
# Try changing the number of points
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2 * x + rnorm(n, sd = 0.5)

plot(x, y, pch = 19, col = "steelblue",
     main = paste("Scatter plot of", n, "points"),
     xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{webr-r}
# Summary statistics
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(fit)
```
